# Amazon Music Next and Previous Helpers for OSX
This project contains a set of applications that can be used to play the next and previous songs within the Amazon Music desktop app on OSX.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure a suitable application (i.e. Logitech Options) to open the applications on a given trigger
3. Enable the application within the 'Accessibility' menu of 'System Preferences' after first trigger.
4. Trigger again and watch it work as expected.

### Note
If Amazon Music is not open, it will pass the next and previous actions onto iTunes.

## Editing
Both apps can be opened with 'Script Editor' on your mac to see how they work.
