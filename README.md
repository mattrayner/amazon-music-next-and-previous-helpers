# Amazon Music Next and Previous Helpers for OSX
This project contains a set of applications that can be used to start/stop and play the next/previous songs within the Amazon Music desktop app on OSX.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository into /Applications
1. Add the applications to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility`
1. Configure a suitable application (i.e. Logitech Options) to open the applications on a given trigger
1. 'Allow' the application when an alert opens up.
1. Trigger again and watch it work as expected.

### Note
If Amazon Music is not open, it will pass the next and previous actions onto iTunes.

## Editing
All apps can be opened with 'Script Editor' on your mac to see how they work.
